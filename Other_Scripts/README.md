# Kaggle Competition : Santander Customer Transation Prediction
### Failed Attempts and lessons learnt:
During the course of this competition, I have tried various methods and ideas. Not all of them worked but it was an interesting exercice to see what would be the impact of trying different technics and methods on the overall performance of my final submission.


[1- H2O Auto ML function failed attemt](/Other_Scripts/Kaggle_H2O_Auto_ML_Function_Test_V03.ipynb)

I called this a failed attemt due to the huge time and effort this function would require. It is a good starting point to get a feel of how different models and methods behave when confronted with the challenge data set. 

However, it is a very time-consuming idea because instead of focusing all the computing powers on a single 'great' model, you will find yourself spending all your time waiting for the 100 model combination H2O is working on.

I would recommend this for people with a very good computing power capacity, and also for people working with a small data set.
